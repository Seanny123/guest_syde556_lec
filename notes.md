There's a lot of subtle math involved in making these memories and relating them to attractors, but this lecture is just going to focus on using them to make functional networks.

Go back to example from previous lecture with the integrator.

Draw the question answering diagram and discuss using the result in some sort of short-term memory.

Draw the associative memory. Input is given by dot product. Each population has positive intercepts.

What if we wanted a threshold beyond the radius? That's why we use the bias

We're going to use 2D vectors, just for ease of visualisation.

Work through the PES rule with them.

We have no idea how to automatically learn vocabularies from sensory mapping,
which feels like a more important problem then automatically setting intercepts.

Work through Su's example with them.

Note on the whiteboard, we're going to need:
- spa.State() with optional feedback=1
- with spa.Actions
  - dot()

  - *

How many people have put in their proposals?

How many people have heard of motor chunking?
